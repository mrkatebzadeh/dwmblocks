* dwmblocks

Modular status bar for dwm written in c.

The statusbar is made from ~blocks~, which generate text output.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the ~config.h~ file.

* Clickable modules

Like i3blocks, this build allows you to build in additional actions into your scripts in response to click events.
See the above linked scripts for examples of this using the ~$BLOCK_BUTTON~ variable.

For this feature to work, you need the appropriate patch in dwm as well. See [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/][here]].
